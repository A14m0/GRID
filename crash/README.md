# Connection-Reduced Agent Session Host
This folder contains the code for the Connection-Reduced Agent Session Host, or
CRASH. This is an example server application whose sole objective is to 
demonstrate GRID server API usage. It is extremely basic and can only handle a 
single connection at a time (as of now).
