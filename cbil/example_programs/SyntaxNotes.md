# Syntax Meeting Note
* Idea of replacing main and whatnot with attaching to certain events (i.e. `refresh.attach()`, `entry.attach()`, ... etc)
* `print` and `printl` distinction (newlines vs no newlines)
* Non-binary errored state for objects
* Including on attach calls num_threads to spawn (Parallel compute idea :) )


## Points of Further Debate
1. Semi-colons vs. no semi-colons
2. Comment symbol (# vs. //)
3. Increment `++` vs `+= 1`
4. Imports and associated crap
5. Deciding orders of operation (maybe variable OoO? -> Clumping like variables?)
6. Inter-thread communications
